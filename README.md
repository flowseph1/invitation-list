# Redux Toolkit Implementation

This project used Redux Toolkit to manage state for an invitation list example. The user will be able to add and remove guests, and the fields will be validated to prevent empty values from being submitted. Additionally, the application will validate whether a guest is already on the list. 

Technologies used: 

- Next.js 
- Redux Toolkit 
- TailwindCSS 
- @formkit/auto-animate
